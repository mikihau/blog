This is my blog where I jot down things that I believe are worth sharing, whether it's for the benefit of someone else on the internet, or simply for my own recollection. It's also a platform for showing off what I've done. With that in mind, I strive to keep this blog focused on technical content, covering topics such as coding, software development, and programming career.
