What I've been reading 01/2023

    The chance I give myself to motivate a new year of previously failed resolutions. What I like about the book is how it breaks down our unwillness to exercise from a historical/evolutional view -- allowing me to be kind to myself when I feel like skipping a workout session. Backed by huge amounts of research detailed in the book, a couple of other big-idea takeaways are succinctly summarized in the last few sentenses of the book:
    > Make exercise necessary and fun. Do mostly cardio, but also some weights. Some is better than none. Keep it up as you age.
